**Website**: https://master--chude.netlify.app/ <br>
**Code**: https://github.com/jordanchude/personal-portfolio

The second version of my personal portfolio website using Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites. The website includes a navbar with links to various sections of the website and links to social media profiles. The hero section includes a background image and a call to action button. The about section includes a brief bio and a list of my skills, tools, and frameworks. The work history section includes a list of my past work and projects. The website is designed to be responsive and optimized for all screen sizes.

I used Vue.js, a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications, to create the dynamic elements of the website, such as the navbar and the hero section. I also used Font Awesome, a popular icon set and toolkit, to enhance the website's design.

To build the website, I started by designing the layout and content using Figma, a popular design tool. I then translated the design into HTML and CSS code, using Bootstrap to expedite the process. I also used jQuery, a JavaScript library for simplifying HTML document traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling and animation, to add interactivity to the website.

The website is optimized for search engines and social media sharing, with metadata for social sharing and links to relevant scripts and stylesheets. The website can be used as a template for a personal portfolio website, with the code and styles easily customizable.
