In addition to working on my projects, I put considerable effort into practicing data structures and algorithms. This is because I believe learning about algorithm patterns and determining the appropriate utilization of certain data structures over others is critical for any software developer.

To help me achieve this goal, I have methodically presented each problem in a distinct directory, complete with a problem statement and any essential information provided in a README file. This ensures that I clearly understand the problem and can approach it with a structured approach.

I have organized the problems by the data structure, with each directory encompassing problems that involve the same data structure. The data structures that are either included or will be included are Linked List, Binary Tree, Stack, Queue, Heap, Trie, and Graph. However, I intend to expand the range of algorithms and data structures covered in this repository in the future.

To implement these problems, I used Javascript. Within each directory, thereâ€™s a solution file with my implementation of the solution and any supplementary files needed to execute the solution (such as input files).

As a software developer, regularly practicing data structures and algorithms is essential. It helps to develop problem-solving skills and enables one to tackle complex problems with a clear and structured approach. Moving forward, I plan to update this repository with new problems and solutions as I progress in my learning journey.

If you have any suggestions or feedback, I would be glad to hear them. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and become a better software developer.
