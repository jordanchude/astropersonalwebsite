During my time in a coding bootcamp, I had the opportunity to contribute to a team-built, full-stack project that involved creating a customized Trello clone. As a full CRUD application, it allowed users to create, read, update, and delete lists and cards within boards. The project was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vue.js), and Ruby on Rails. One of the key features of the project was its use of JWT authentication to manage user accounts.

As a member of the team, I took on the role of team lead, overseeing the work of four other engineers. This involved conducting daily code reviews, quality assurance testing, and debugging to ensure that the project ran smoothly and met our goals. One standout feature that I contributed to was the implementation of a drag-and-drop feature that allowed users to move cards between lists within a board. This was the only drag-and-drop feature in the entire class, and we were able to create it by leveraging event listeners and HTTP requests to delete the original item and create a new one in its new location. This required a significant amount of coding and testing, but I was proud of the result and the way it improved the user experience of the application.

Overall, this project was a significant learning experience for me, both in terms of technical skills and teamwork. It taught me the importance of clear communication, effective leadership, and collaboration in a team environment. I am proud to have been a part of this project and to have contributed to its success.
