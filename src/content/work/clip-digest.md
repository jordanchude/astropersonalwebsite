Creator Assessment Utility is a multi-platform creator evaluation and ranking tool developed for a specific team at Twitch, streamlining their data-driven decision-making process in creator acquisitions. As an experienced developer and Twitch team member, I designed this Python-based application to analyze creators across various social media platforms, such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram.

The core functionality of this application involves automating the evaluation and ranking of creators based on customizable criteria, allowing users to adjust weights assigned to each platform according to their needs. Leveraging the Google Sheets API for seamless data import/export and the Pandas library for efficient data analysis and manipulation, this tool provides valuable insights into creator performance and competition.

To provide an overview of the project structure, the MVP comprises several components, including the integration of various APIs, data analysis using Python libraries, and a customizable ranking system. Throughout the development process, I worked closely with the Technical Program Manager to refine project requirements, discuss potential tools, and establish development approaches, drawing on past scripts and shared expertise.

While the project's minimum viable product (MVP) focuses on automating creator evaluation and ranking, plans for future enhancements include refining data analysis techniques, expanding compatibility with additional social media platforms, and developing a user-friendly interface for non-engineer team members at Twitch to utilize the tool effectively.
