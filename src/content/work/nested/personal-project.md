In this project, I built a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Although it doesn't represent my fully encapsulate my current skillset, it was one of the first solo projects I built.

The portfolio website has four sections: home, about me, projects and contact. In the home section, I have a brief introduction of myself and a button jumps to a contact section. In the about me section, I have more details about my skillsets. In the projects section, I have a grid of cards that display some of the projects I have worked on or contributed to. Each card has an image, a title, a description and a link to the live demo or source code. In the contact section, I have a form that allows visitors to send me messages directly from the website. I also have links to my social media profiles and email address.

I used HTML to structure the content of my website and CSS to style it. I used CSS grid and flexbox to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. I also used some CSS animations and transitions to add some interactivity and visual effects. For example, I added hover effects to the project cards. I used JavaScript to add some functionality and dynamic behavior to my website.

This is a strong but mighty project and laid the foundation for me to continue learning web development / software engineering.
