As a final project for my coding boot camp, I created a movie database called 'Cinefavorites'. This project was a culmination of all the skills and knowledge I have gained throughout the course, and it was exciting to see all of my hard work come to fruition.

Cinefavorites is a web application that allows users to create a login and add their favorite movies to a list of films. Users can add a title, director, description, and image to each movie. After adding a movie, the dashboard displays the image and title of the film. Once the user clicks on the film, they can see the image, title, and movie description on a separate page. On the separate page, they can add platforms to stream and/or download the movie.

Cinefavorites was built using Django as the backend and Vue.js as the frontend. For the database, I used PostgreSQL, and the deployed version is hosted on Heroku. I implemented user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to create a secure login system. I followed a strict project schedule to ensure I met all my deadlines. I started by creating a project description and wireframes. I then created a working REST API and began working on the core application structure (HTML, CSS, etc.). After that, I worked on the MVP and bug fixes before completing the final touches and presenting my project.

Throughout the development process, I encountered several challenges. One of the most significant challenges was implementing user authentication using JWT. However, after researching and learning more about JWT, I overcame this challenge and created a secure login system.

While I am proud of my work on Cinefavorites, there is always room for improvement. In the future, I would like to add additional features, such as a rating system for movies and the ability for users to leave reviews. I would also like to improve the website's design and make it more visually appealing. Overall, creating Cinefavorites was an incredible experience. It allowed me to showcase my skills and knowledge while gaining new insights and knowledge. I am excited to continue working on this project and improving it.
